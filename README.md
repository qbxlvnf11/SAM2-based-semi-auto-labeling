SAM2-Based Semi-Auto Segmentation Labeling Using anylabeling
=============

#### - [SAM2 (Segment-Anything-2)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2)
  - Universal segmentation tool: SAM is designed to work across different domains without task-specific tuning, making it highly generalizable.
  - High-quality masks: SAM produces high-resolution and accurate masks, making it a valuable tool for pixel-precise segmentation.
  - Zero-shot capabilities: SAM does not need retraining for new image types or segmentation tasks.
  - Prompt-based interaction (Points): The user can click on specific points to guide the model in segmenting objects.
  
#### - Data labeling tools: [anylabeling](https://github.com/vietanhdev/anylabeling)
  - Useful and convenient labeling tool that supports SAM2
  - Create a label using SAM2 installed in this tool
